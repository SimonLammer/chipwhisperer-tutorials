Part 2, Topic 2: Voltage Glitching to Bypass Password
=====================================================



**SUMMARY:** *We‚Äôve seen how voltage glitching can be used to corrupt
calculations, just like clock glitching. Let‚Äôs continue on and see if it
can also be used to break past a password check.*

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

-  Applying previous glitch settings to new firmware
-  Checking for success and failure when glitching
