SOLUTION WITH SIMULATION: Part 2, Topic 1, Lab B: Power Analysis for Password Bypass
====================================================================================



**SUMMARY:** *This tutorial will introduce you to breaking devices by
determining when a device is performing certain operations. Our target
device will be performing a simple password check, and we will
demonstrate how to perform a basic power analysis.*

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

-  How power can be used to determine timing information.
-  Plotting multiple iterations while varying input data to find
   interesting locations.
-  Using difference of waveforms to find interesting locations.
-  Performing power captures with ChipWhisperer hardware (hardware only)

Prerequisites
-------------

Hold up! Before you continue, check you‚Äôve done the following tutorials:

-  ‚òë Jupyter Notebook Intro (you should be OK with plotting & running
   blocks).
-  ‚òë SCA101 Intro (you should have an idea of how to get
   hardware-specific versions running).

Power Trace Gathering
---------------------

At this point you‚Äôve got to insert code to perform the power trace
capture. There are two options here: \* Capture from physical device. \*
Read from a file.

You get to choose your adventure - see the two notebooks with the same
name of this, but called ``(SIMULATED)`` or ``(HARDWARE)`` to continue.
Inside those notebooks you should get some code to copy into the
following section, which will define the capture function.

Be sure you get the ``"‚úîÔ∏è OK to continue!"`` print once you run the next
cell, otherwise things will fail later on!

Exploration
-----------

So what can we do with this? While first off - I‚Äôm going to cheat, and
tell you that we have a preset password that starts with ``h``, and it‚Äôs
5 characters long. But that‚Äôs the only hint so far - what can you do?
While first off, let‚Äôs try plotting a comparison of ``h`` to something
else.

If you need a reminder of how to do a plot - see the matplotlib section
of the **Jupyter Introduction** notebook.

The following cell shows you how to capture one power trace with ``h``
sent as a password. From there:

1. Try adding the plotting code and see what it looks like.
2. Send different passwords to the device. We‚Äôre only going to look at
   the difference between a password starting with ``h`` and something
   else right now.
3. Plot the different waveforms.


**In [4]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    #Example - capture 'h' - end with newline '\n' as serial protocol expects that
    trace_h = cap_pass_trace("h\n")
    
    print(trace_h)

    plt.plot(cap_pass_trace("0\n"))
    plt.show()
    # ###################

For reference, the output should look something like this:

If you are using the ``%matplotlib notebook`` magic, you can zoom in at
the start. What you want to notice is there is two code paths taken,
depending on a correct or incorrect path. Here for example is a correct
& incorrect character processed:

OK interesting ‚Äì what‚Äôs next? Let‚Äôs plot every possible password
character we could send.

Our password implementation only recognizes characters in the list
``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789``, so we‚Äôre going to limit it to
those valid characters for now.

Write some code in the following block that implements the following
algorithm:

::

   for CHARACTER in LIST_OF_VALID_CHARACTERS:
       trace = cap_pass_trace(CHARACTER + "\n")
       plot(trace)
       

The above isn‚Äôt quite valid code - so massage it into place! You also
may notice the traces are way too long - you might want to make a more
narrow plot that only does the first say 500 samples of the power trace.

    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
    plt.figure()
    for c in tqdm('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'):
        trace = cap_pass_trace(c + "\n")
        plt.plot(trace[0:500])

.. image:: img/CWNANO-CWNANO-courses_sca101_SOLN_Lab2_1B-PowerAnalysisforPasswordBypass_16_3.png


The end result should be if you zoom in, you‚Äôll see there is a location
where a single ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù trace doesn‚Äôt follow the path of all the other
traces. That is great news, since it means we learn something about the
system from power analysis.

Using your loop - you can also try modifying the analysis to capture a
correct ‚Äúfirst‚Äù character, and then every other wrong second character.
Do you see a difference you might be able to detect?

The pseudo-code would look something like this:

::

   for CHARACTER in LIST_OF_VALID_CHARACTERS:
       trace = cap_pass_trace("h" + CHARACTER + "\n")
       plot(trace)

Give that a shot in your earlier code-block, and then let‚Äôs try and
automate this attack to understand the data a little better.

Automating an Attack against One Character
------------------------------------------

To start with - we‚Äôre going to automate an attack against a **single**
character of the password. Since we don‚Äôt know the password (let‚Äôs
assume), we‚Äôll use a strategy of comparing all possible inputs together.

An easy way to do this might be to use something that we know can‚Äôt be
part of the valid password. As long as it‚Äôs processed the same way, this
will work just fine. So for now, let‚Äôs use a password as ``0x00`` (i.e.,
a null byte). We can compare the null byte to processing something else:


**In [6]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    %matplotlib inline
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    
    plt.figure()
    ref_trace = cap_pass_trace("\x00\n")[0:500]
    plt.plot(ref_trace)
    other_trace = cap_pass_trace("c\n")[0:500]
    plt.plot(other_trace)
    plt.show()


**Out [6]:**



.. parsed-literal::

    WARNING:root:SAM3U Serial buffers OVERRUN - data loss has occurred.
    



.. image:: img/CWNANO-CWNANO-courses_sca101_SOLN_Lab2_1B-PowerAnalysisforPasswordBypass_20_1.png


This will plot a trace with an input of ‚Äú:raw-latex:`\x00`‚Äù - a null
password! This is an invalid character, and seems to be processed as any
other invalid password.

Let‚Äôs make this a little more obvious, and plot the difference between a
known reference & every other capture. You need to write some code that
does something like this:

::

   ref_trace = cap_pass_trace( "\x00\n")

   for CHARACTER in LIST_OF_VALID_CHARACTERS:
       trace = cap_pass_trace(CHARACTER + "\n")
       plot(trace - ref_trace)

Again, you may need to modify this a little bit such as adding code to
make a new ``figure()``. Also notice in the above example how I reduced
the number of samples.

OK great - hopefully you now see one major ‚Äúdifference‚Äù. It should look
something like this:

What do do now? Let‚Äôs make this thing automatically detect such a large
difference. Some handy stuff to try out is the ``np.sum()`` and
``np.abs()`` function.

The first one will get absolute values:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   np.abs([-1, -3, 1, -5, 6])

       Out[]: array([1, 3, 1, 5, 6])

The second one will add up all the numbers.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np    
   np.sum([-1, -3, 1, -5, 6])

       Out[]: -2

Using just ``np.sum()`` means positive and negative differences will
cancel each other out - so it‚Äôs better to do something like
``np.sum(np.abs(DIFF))`` to get a good number indicating how ‚Äúclose‚Äù the
match was.


**In [8]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    np.abs([-1, -3, 1, -5, 6])

Taking your above loop, modify it to print an indicator of how closely
this matches your trace. Something like the following should work:

::

   ref_trace = cap_pass_trace( "\x00\n")

   for CHARACTER in LIST_OF_VALID_CHARACTERS:
       trace = cap_pass_trace(CHARACTER + "\n")
       diff = SUM(ABS(trace - ref_trace))

       print("{:1} diff = {:2}".format(CHARACTER, diff))

Now the easy part - modify your above code to automatically print the
correct password character. This should be done with a comparison of the
``diff`` variable - based on the printed characters, you should see one
that is ‚Äòhigher‚Äô than the others. Set a threshold somewhere reasonable
(say I might use ``25.0`` based on one run).

Running a Full Attack
---------------------

Finally - let‚Äôs finish this off. Rather than attacking a single
character, we need to attack each character in sequence.

If you go back to the plotting of differences, you can try using the
correct first character & wrong second character. The basic idea is
exactly the same as before, but now we loop through 5 times, and just
build up the password based on brute-forcing each character.

Take a look at the following for the basic pseudo-code:

::

   guessed_pw = "" #Store guessed password so far

   do a loop 5 times (max password size):
       
       ref_trace = capture power trace(guessed_pw + "\x00\n")
       
       for CHARACTER in LIST_OF_VALID_CHARACTERS:
           trace = capture power trace (guessed_pw + CHARACTER + newline)
           diff = SUM(ABS(trace - ref_trace))
           
           if diff > THRESHOLD:
               
               guessed_pwd += c
               print(guessed_pw)
               
               break


**In [12]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    # ###################
    # START SOLUTION
    # ###################
    
    guessed_pw = ""
    
    
    for _ in range(0, 5):  
    
        ref_trace = cap_pass_trace(guessed_pw + "\x00\n")
        
        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789': 
            trace = cap_pass_trace(guessed_pw + c + "\n")
            diff = np.sum(np.abs(trace - ref_trace))
    
            if diff > 40.0:
                guessed_pw += c
                print(guessed_pw)
                break
    
    # ###################
    # END SOLUTION

**Out [12]:**



.. parsed-literal::

    h
    h0
    h0p
    h0px
    h0px3
    


You should get an output that looks like this:

::

   h
   h0
   h0p
   h0px
   h0px3

If so - ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ Congrats - you did it!!!!

If not - check some troubleshooting hints below. If you get really
stuck, check the ``SOLN`` version (there is one for both with hardware
and simulated).

Troubleshooting - Always get ‚Äòh‚Äô
--------------------------------

Some common problems you might run into - first, if you get an output
which keeps guessing the first character:

::

   h
   hh
   hhh
   hhhh
   hhhhh

Check that when you run the ``cap_pass_trace`` inside the loop (checking
the guessed password), are you updating the prefix of the password? For
example, the old version of the code (guessing a single character)
looked like this:

::

   trace = cap_pass_trace(c + "\n")

But that is always sending our first character only! So we need to send
the ‚Äúknown good password so far‚Äù. In the example code something like
this:

::

   trace = cap_pass_trace(guessed_pw + c + "\n")

Where ``guessed_pw`` progressively grows with the known good start of
the password.

Troubleshooting - Always get ‚Äòa‚Äô
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This looks like it‚Äôs always matching the first character:

::

   h
   ha
   haa
   haaa
   haaaa

Check that you update the ``ref_trace`` - if you re-use the original
reference trace, you won‚Äôt be looking at a reference where the first N
characters are good, and the remaining characters are bad. An easy way
to do this is again using the ``guessed_pw`` variable and appending a
null + newline:

::

   trace = cap_pass_trace(guessed_pw + "\x00\n")
